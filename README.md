**Evaluation of Data Visualization on Global Warming**

**Scenario**: This assignment relied on a data set that included data on countries that emitted Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from 2005 to 2014 and were responsible for global warming. The objective of selecting this dataset is to explore an overall picture of the countries where a large amount of CO2 emission occurred between the years 2005 and 2014.

**Conclusion**: We visualized 5 kinds of graphs and charts, which explored different themes and described different aspects of our dataset. We analysed our visualization using Tufteâ€™s Principle and Junk Chart Trifecta Check-up. However, we were unable to visualize our requirement using the visualization tools packed bubbles and symbol maps, while we succeeded in all other charts.
